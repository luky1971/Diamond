Diamond is an open-source, cross-platform, high-performance C++ game engine. Its simple and user-friendly API can be integrated with any number of backend implementations optimized for specific platforms. Using Diamond's API, a game can be published to multiple platforms without modifying a single line of code. Backends for Windows, Android, and iOS are currently under development.
