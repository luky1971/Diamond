#Diamond

Diamond is a free, open-source, cross-platform C++ game engine that prioritizes simplicity and performance over fancy features. It is designed to allow for easy integration of different backend implementations optimized for different platforms. Diamond is a work in progress, and the only backend implementation currently included is the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.
