#Diamond

Diamond is a free, open-source, cross-platform C++ game engine that prioritizes simplicity and performance over fancy features. It is designed to allow for easy integration of different backend implementations optimized for different platforms, while hiding them all behind one very user-friendly API. A game made with Diamond can be easily published to and optimized for all supported platforms from the same code base. Diamond is a work in progress, and the only platform currently supported is Windows. The Windows backend implementation uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.
