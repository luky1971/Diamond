#Diamond

Diamond is a free, open-source, cross-platform C++ game engine that prioritizes performance over features. It is designed to allow for easy integration of different backend implementations optimized for different platforms, while hiding them all behind one very user-friendly API. A game made with Diamond can be easily published to all supported platforms without modifying a single line of code. Support for Windows, Android, and iOS is currently under development.

The backend implementations for Windows, Android, and iOS use the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, Copyright (c) 1997-2014 Sam Lantinga <slouken@libsdl.org>.
