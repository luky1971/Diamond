#Diamond

Diamond is an open-source, cross-platform, high-performance C++ game engine. Its simple and user-friendly API can be integrated with any backend implementation optimized for specific platforms. Using Diamond's API, a game can be published to multiple platforms without modifying a single line of code. Support for Windows, Android, and iOS is currently under development.

The SDL backend implementation uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library, Copyright (c) 1997-2014 Sam Lantinga <slouken@libsdl.org>.
